  <h3>Basics</h3>
  
  <p>This site aggregates data on certain money market and bond funds from Fidelity, Schwab and
    Vanguard.  Most importantly, it displays standardized measures of yields, including
    tax-equivalent yields.</p>

  <p>The 7-day yield is a standard measure of the yield of a money market fund.  It takes the
    gain of the fund over the last seven days and annualizes it; i.e., it extrapolates the gains
    of the last seven days to what you would see over an entire year.  It is net of expenses.</p>
  
  <p>The 30-day yield is very similar to the 7-day yield, except instead of using the last
    seven days, it uses the last 30 days.  It is a standard measure of the yield of a bond
    fund.</p>

  <h3>Tax-Equivalent Yield</h3>

  <p>Notice that different funds get taxed differently.  For example, the Vanguard California Money
    Market Fund is free of state and federal taxes if you are a California taxpayer.  In contrast,
    the Vanguard Treasury Money Market fund is free of state taxes, but fully taxable at the federal
    level.  And other funds may be fully taxable both federally and at the state level.</p>
  
  <p>The tax-equivalent yield of a fund lets you compare funds that are taxed differently on an
    apples-to-apples basis.  It lets you see which would earn you more on an after-tax basis, which
    is, after all, what you should care about.  The tax-equivalent yield of a fund is the yield you
    would need to earn on a fully taxable fund, in order to get the same after-tax yield as the
    given fund.</p>

  <p>As an example, suppose you are a Califonia taxpayer in the 37% federal tax bracket and the
    10.3% state tax bracket.  Suppose the 7-day yield of the California Money Market Fund is 2%.  On
    a fully taxable fund you would be taxed at a rate of 0.37 + 0.103.  (Technical note: we are
    assuming you do not itemize deductions.)  If F is the 7-day yield on that fund, then your
    after-tax yield on that fund is F * (1 - 0.37 - 0.103).  For our calculations, we want to set
    the after-tax yield of this fund equal to 2%, so we have F * (1 - 0.37 - 0.103) = 0.02.
    Dividing through, we get that the pre-tax yield of the fund must be 0.02 / (1 - 0.37 - 0.103)
    which is 0.03795.  So the tax-equivalent yield of the California Money Market Fund, for you, is
    3.795%.</p>

  <p>The tax-equivalent yield of a fund depends on information about you, principally your tax
    brackets.  Fill in the information at the bottom of the screen in order to see tax-equivalent
    yields.  Your taxable income, filing status, and state let us determine your state and federal
    marginal tax brackets.  Your investment income lets us see if you are subject to the Net
    Investment Income Tax (NIIT).</p>

  <p>We are using the 2023 tax brackets for our calculations.  Yields are scraped from the
    websites of Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard.</p>
    
  <h3>User Interface</h3>

  <p>Please click on the sort icon (<i class="fas fa-sort"></i>) next to the column header to sort
    on that column.</p>

  <p>You must fill in the form at the bottom (at least your state and taxable income) to see
    tax-equivalent yields.</p>
  
  <h3>Limitations</h3>

  <p>We only can calculate state taxes for California and New York currently.</p>
  
  <p>We do not take account of the federal tax deduction you may be entitled to for state and
    local taxes (which is limited to $10,000 in any case).</p>

  <p>We do not take the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) into account.</p>
